# Versioning Guidelines

## Version Numbering
1. **Semantic Versioning:**
    - Adhere to the principles of Semantic Versioning with the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
    - Increment the:
        - **MAJOR** version for significant updates or major enhancements.
        - **MINOR** version for additional features.
        - **PATCH** version for bug fixes and minor improvements.
2. **Pre-release Versions:**
    - Use pre-release versions (e.g., `1.0.0-alpha.1`, `1.0.0-beta.2`) to indicate work in progress.
    - Clearly communicate the purpose and scope of pre-release versions.
